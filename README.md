I developed this interactive dashboard to analyze global vehicle sales performance. This project transforms raw data into actionable business insights to track operational efficiency and consumer behavior.

## Technical Implementation:
- Used Excel Pivot Tables for data summarization and multi-dimensional analysis.
- Created an insightful, interactive dashboard featuring dynamic visualizations and slicers to allow users to filter data in real-time.

## Dashboard Features:
- Sales distribution by country and global regions.
- Yearly sales performance comparison across 2003,2004 and 2005.
- Sales by product line to identify customer preferences.
- Sales proportion based on deal size (Small, Medium, and Large).
- Real-time monitoring of: (Total Sales, Average Sales, and Number of Orders).


## Key Analytical Insights:
- The **(EMEA)** region achieved the highest sales, contributing 50% of total global sales.
- **Classic Cars** was the leading product category, outperforming all other vehicle types.
- **2004** recorded the highest sales compared to 2003 and 2005.
- The majority of sales come from **Medium-Sized** deals contributing approximately 60% of total sales throughout the analysis period.
